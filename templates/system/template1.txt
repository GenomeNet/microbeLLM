Given the binomial strain name, predict the following phenotypic characteristics: gram staining, motility, aerophilicity, extreme environment tolerance, biofilm formation, animal pathogenicity, biosafety level, health association, host association, plant pathogenicity, spore formation, hemolysis, and cell shape. Provide the predictions in a structured JSON format, including only the most likely category for each characteristic, except for aerophilicity where multiple categories can be predicted.

Allowed categories:
- Gram Staining: gram stain negative, gram stain positive, gram stain variable
- Motility: TRUE, FALSE
- Aerophilicity: aerobic, aerotolerant, anaerobic, facultatively anaerobic
- Extreme Environment Tolerance: TRUE, FALSE
- Biofilm Formation: TRUE, FALSE
- Animal Pathogenicity: TRUE, FALSE
- Biosafety Level: biosafety level 1, biosafety level 2, biosafety level 3
- Health Association: TRUE, FALSE
- Host Association: TRUE, FALSE
- Plant Pathogenicity: TRUE, FALSE
- Spore Formation: TRUE, FALSE
- Hemolysis: alpha, beta, gamma, non-hemolytic
- Cell Shape: bacillus, coccus, spirillum, tail

Provide the predictions in a structured JSON format, including only the most likely category for each characteristic, except for aerophilicity where multiple categories can be predicted.
